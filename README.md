# Programming Portfolio - Computer Programming Module

**Student Name:** Sandesh Basnet  
**Student ID:** 77576075  

## Overview
This repository contains my submission for the **Programming Portfolio** as part of the **Computer Programming Module** at Leeds Beckett University. The portfolio showcases my progress and understanding of key programming concepts, including procedural programming, sequence, selection, iteration, variables, and data types. It also demonstrates my ability to write, debug, and execute functional programs using Python.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into the following sections, following the structure provided in the module guidelines:

- **portfolio/**  
  Contains weekly tasks. Each week's work is stored in a separate folder. While not all tasks are completed, this demonstrates consistent effort and understanding.

- **project-f1/**  
  A project demonstrating the analysis of Formula 1 race data. Refer to this folder for project-specific details and implementation.

- **exam/**  
  Contains solutions to the exam tasks (if applicable). These tasks are designed to validate my independent understanding and work.

## Key Features
### Weekly Tasks
1. **Commented Code for Easy Understanding**  
   Every program in the weekly tasks includes comments to explain the logic, purpose of functions, and variables. This ensures the code is easy to follow for anyone reviewing it.

2. **Demonstration of Key Programming Concepts**  
   The tasks cover a variety of programming principles, such as sequence, selection, iteration, and data types.

### F1 Project
1. **Race Data Analysis**  
   The project processes driver details and lap time records to analyze and generate reports for Formula 1 races. Key features include:  
   - Fastest lap identification  
   - Overall average lap time calculation  
   - Detailed driver lap time analysis, including fastest and average lap times  
   - Sorting and displaying fastest lap times in descending order  

2. **Visualization**  
   Using the **matplotlib** library, the project generates bar charts that compare the fastest and average lap times of drivers.

3. **Input Handling**  
   - Reads and parses driver information from a CSV file.  
   - Processes multiple lap time files to compute results for different race venues.  

4. **Report Generation**  
   - Outputs detailed tables using the **tabulate** library for structured and readable results.  
   - Provides race summaries with fastest lap data and driver performance.

5. **Error Handling**  
   - Handles missing or incorrectly formatted files gracefully.  
   - Issues warnings for invalid lap data or incomplete driver information.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python 3  
- **Libraries Used:**
  - **matplotlib**: For visualizing lap times.  
  - **tabulate**: For generating structured tables in the console.  
  - **sys**: For handling command-line arguments.  
- **IDE:** VS Code  
- **Repository Management:** Git and GitHub
